This is a shopping list app that has a server side using Ktor framework. I have built this app mainly to practice Ktor and Compose.
The followings are the technologies and liberaries that I applied in building this app:
1) I used Jetpack Compose to build the UI of this app.
2) Retrofit to retrive data from the server side.
3) Hilt dagger for depedency injection.
4) Compose Destination liberary for navigation. 
5) Coil for loading images.
6) Paging 3.0 for pagination.
7) Room for caching cart items.
8) Datastore.
9) Canvas with Compose.
10) Flow and Coroutines.
11) Clean Architecture with MVVM.
